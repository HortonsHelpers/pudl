Work in Progress
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to a grant from the `Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Energy & Environment
Program <https://sloan.org/programs/research/energy-and-environment>`__, we
have support to integrate the following new datasets.


.. _data-tmolmp:

ISO/RTO LMP
^^^^^^^^^^^

Locational marginal electricity pricing information from the various grid
operators (e.g. MISO, CAISO, NEISO, PJM, ERCOT...). At high time resolution,
with many different delivery nodes, this will be a very large dataset (hundreds
of GB). The format for the data is different for each of the ISOs. Physical
location of the delivery nodes is not always publicly available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a huge variety and quantity of data about the US electric utility
system available to the public. The data listed above is just the beginning!
Other data we've heard demand for are listed below. If you're interested in
using one of them, and would like to add it to PUDL, check out :doc:`our
contribution guidelines <../CONTRIBUTING>`. If there are other datasets you think
we should be looking at integration, don't hesitate to `open an issue on Github
<https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues>`_ requesting the data and
explaining why it would be useful.

.. _data-eiah20:

EIA Water Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`EIA Water <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/water/>`_ records water use by
thermal generating stations in the US.

.. _data-ferc714:

FERC Form 714
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`FERC Form 714 <https://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/forms/form-714/data.asp>`_
includes hourly loads, reported by load balancing authorities annually. This is
a modestly sized dataset, in the 100s of MB, distributed as Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets.

.. _data-ferceqr:

FERC EQR
^^^^^^^^^

The `FERC EQR <https://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/eqr/q2-2013/data/database.asp>`_
Also known as the Electricity Quarterly Report or Form 920, this dataset
includes the details of many transactions between different utilities, and
between utilities and merchant generators. It covers ancillary services as well
as energy and capacity, time and location of delivery, prices, contract length,
etc. It's one of the few public sources of information about renewable energy
power purchase agreements (PPAs). This is a large (~100s of GB) dataset,
composed of a very large number of relatively clean CSV files, but it requires
fuzzy processing to get at some of the interesting and only indirectly
reported attributes.

MSHA Mines and Production
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `MSHA Mines & Production
<https://arlweb.msha.gov/OpenGovernmentData/OGIMSHA.asp>`_ dataset describes
coal production by mine and operating company, along with statistics about
labor productivity and safety. This is a smaller dataset (100s of MB) available
as relatively clean and well structured CSV files.

PHMSA Natural Gas Pipelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `PHMSA Natural Gas Pipelines <https://cms.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/gas-distribution-gas-gathering-gas-transmission-hazardous-liquids>`_
dataset, published by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (which is part of the US Dept. of Transportation) collects data
about the natural gas transmission and distribution system, including their
age, length, diameter, materials, and carrying capacity.

Transmission and Distribution Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to run electricity system operations models and cost optimizations,
you need some kind of model of the interconnections between generation and
loads. There doesn't appear to be a generally accepted, publicly available set
of these network descriptions (yet!).

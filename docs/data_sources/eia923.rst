=================== ===========================================================

Nearly all of EIA Form 923 is being pulled into the PUDL database, for years
2009-2018. Earlier data is available from EIA, but the reporting format for
earlier years is substantially different from the present day, and will require
more work to integrate. Monthly year to date releases are not yet being
integrated, and only larger utilities are required to make monthly reports.

We have not yet integrated tables reporting fuel stocks on hand, data from
Puerto Rico, or EIA 923 schedules 6, 7, and 8.

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

The *Annual Electric Power Industry Report*, also known as Form EIA-861, elicits
information on load, generation, capacity, sales, revenues, programs, and more.
The EIA-861 exists in parallel with its "short form" counterpart,
**the EIA-861S, which is not yet included in the PUDL database.** The short form was
created in 2012 to reduce the respondent burden for entities producing under
100,000 MWh of power. Every eight years, these entities are required to fill out
the full form. Year-to-year, approximately 1,100 utilities complete the EIA-861S
and 2,300 utilities complete the full EIA-861.

EIA also solicits information for a *Monthly Electric Power Industry Report*, the
EIA-861M, however all the monthly information is encapsulated in the Annual EIA-861.
**PUDL only draws from EIA-861M if a user requests year-to-date information that
isn't yet available in its annual form.**

.. todo::
    Confirm the role of EIA-861M and EIA-861S in PUDL

**Who is required to fill out the form?**

As mandated by Section 13(b) of the Federal Energy Administration Act (FEAA) of
1974 and specified by the Form instructions, respondents include:
“electric power industry entities such as, but not limited to:

  * Electric utilities,
  * All Demand Side Management (DSM) Program Managers (entities responsible for
    conducting or administering a DSM program), wholesale power marketers, energy
    service providers, electric power producers, transmission owners, transmission
    operators.
  * Third Party Owners of solar PV (TPO).

Responses are collected at the operating company level (not at the holding
company level).”

Annual responses are due by April 30th, and failure to respond may result in
fines of several thousand dollars per day, depending on the infraction and
form in question. Under Title 18 U.S.C. 1001, submitting false information is
considered a criminal offense and warrants the highest fine.

**What does the data look like?**

Once the respondents have submitted their data, EIA creates a series of
spreadsheets that reflect themes from the form. These spreadsheets have changed
over the years as the form itself evolves. To gain greater insight into
year-to-year nuances of the form, we recommend downloading the EIA-861 zip files
for the desired years from the `EIA website
<https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/>`__ and scrutinizing both the Form
and the Form Instructions files. `Form EIA-861 FAQ
<https://www.eia.gov/survey/form/eia_861/faqs.php>`__, can also provide clarity
on the contents of the data.

Notable Irregularities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. §552, the Department of Energy
(DOE) regulations, 10 C.F.R. §1004.11, implementing the FOIA, and the Trade
﻿Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. §1905 allow qualifying respondents to restrict
access to their data. According to sources at the EIA, around 3
respondents have used this as a means to keep their data utility-level data
private. These entries appear under the utility id ``88888`` in the data.

The EIA also performs state-level imputations and adjustments for more accurate
state- level analysis. These entries appear under the utility id ``99999``
and are not intended for use in utility-level aggregations.

.. todo::
    Say more about the state-level adjustments (99999) and maybe why power marketer
    data is guarded.

Not all of the EIA-861 data span all years. As mentioned earlier, both the Form
and its output files have changed over time; most notably between 2012 and 2013.
Beginning in 2013, the EIA split it's Demand Side Management spreadsheet into
two: Demand Response and Energy Efficiency in order to reduce ambiguity and
ensure data reliability. While there are many similarities between the two
years, EIA officials recommend against combining data from these three files,
citing subtle differences in Form questions. For these files, the post-2012 DR
and EE spreadsheets are considered more accurate.

PUDL Data Transformations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These raw inputs are extracted by PUDL, cleaned, and transformed for efficient
storage in the database. The data from each of these tables can be accessed
either by querying the SQL database or interacting with PUDL output tables.

.. note::
    Add transformation details about the EIA861 output tables.
